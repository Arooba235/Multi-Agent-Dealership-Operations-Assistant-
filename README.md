# AutoAdvisor (LLM-Powered Car Recommendation System)
## Overview
AutoAdvisor is an intelligent, multi-agent system designed to help users make informed decisions when buying a car. The system uses a structured agent workflow—Researcher, Inventory Analyst, Pricing Strategist, and Recommendation Agent—managed by a Supervisor (LangGraph). Each agent performs a specialized task, and the final output is a personalized car recommendation.The application includes a simple dashboard where you can update customer details (name, budget, max mileage, preferences, etc.). These inputs are stored locally and passed to the multi-agent reasoning pipeline. The final recommendation is generated using the Groq LLM.
